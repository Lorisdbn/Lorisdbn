# 👋 Hi, I'm Loris

I’m a Business Operations leader turned Data / BI Analyst, with 10+ years of experience driving operational performance, building scalable systems, and transforming raw data into actionable business insights.

After a decade leading large teams, optimizing operations, and owning P&L responsibilities across France and Africa, I shifted my focus to data analytics, applying the same business-driven mindset to solve analytical problems.

I enjoy working at the intersection of **operations, analytics, and product**, especially in fast-moving environments where data directly supports decision-making.

## 🔎 What I do

- Turn complex datasets into clear insights to support strategic decisions  
- Build dashboards and data apps that enable teams to act faster  
- Design predictive models to improve planning, performance, and customer outcomes  
- Work comfortably across SQL, Python, BI tools, and product+ops contexts  
- Communicate insights to both technical and non-technical stakeholders  

My background spans mobility, logistics, retail, fintech, and international operations — always with a strong data orientation.
